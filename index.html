<p>The German Rex is a small to medium-sized cat, with a wavy coat. They are a highly intelligent breed, nicknamed the "Einsteins of the cat world." Because of their intelligence, they love
to play interactive games and puzzle games. They are also very affectionate and able to get along with everyone, even dogs.</p>
 
<p>The German Rex was developed in Germany, when a feral female cat was rescued from the ruins of East Berlin, after World War II. The person who rescued her named her Lammchen, which means 
 Lambkin, due to her wavy black fur. She was then bred with one of her wavy coated offspring, to produce the first litter of German Rex kittens.</p>
